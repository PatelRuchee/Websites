<p> Practing <b> HTML </b> is fun. So far we have learned <strong> HTML </strong> is a language made of <em> tags that are needed for the program to work.</em> <br>  We can learn about new tags when we need them.
 </p>      <!-- br= break tag, it will break the text to the next line.
 strong=  changes the format of word, make letter bold
  b= bold, make word more bold
  em= italics-->
